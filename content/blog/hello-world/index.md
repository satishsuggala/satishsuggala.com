Alright, this should be fun.

Was trying to setup a blog and eventually poked around the venerable <a href="https://twitter.com/ulhas_sm">@ulhas_sm</a> for some advise around what is the easiest way to do this. He dared me to try something that wasn't wordpress. Challenge accepted.

As for the purpose of me taking the effort to do this
- Getting back to writing, ffs (thank you to the many folks who nudged me to do this, you know who you are ❤️)
- To share a little bit of my perspective of the world as a Product Manager. Hopefully it will be useful to you.
- This a barebones blog setup and I will eventually start missing all of the features that Wordpress has. Which in turn will cause me to start messing around with Gatsby, React & the JS ecosystem. F-U-N.

For those who care to know, this blog was setup using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">gatsby-starter-blog</a> & <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">netlify</a>. Was able to do it in under an hour and FOR FREE! What sorcery is this i dont even. Mad props. If not for them, I'd still be spending time making PHP7 talk to nginx & mysql while figuring out the right SEO plugin. Done is decidedly better than perfect.

Also, I'll be going from being @MindYoghurt on Twitter for 10+ years to my full name. I no longer have the Engineering undergrad angst I did when I set this up. Also, back in the early days of Twitter, I had @satish for a couple of weeks. Do I regret giving that up for being the English version of "Dimaag ka Dahi"? Nope. Not one bit.

See you around!

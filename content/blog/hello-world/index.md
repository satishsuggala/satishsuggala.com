Alright, this should be fun.

Was trying to set up a blog and eventually poked around the venerable <a href="https://twitter.com/ulhas_sm">@ulhas_sm</a> for some advice around what is the easiest way to do this. He dared me to try something that wasn't Wordpress. Challenge accepted.

As for the purpose of me making the effort to do this :
- Getting back to writing, FFS (thank you to the many folks who nudged me to do this, you know who you are ❤️)
- To share a little bit of my perspective of the world as a Product nerd. Hopefully, I can distil it in a format that will be useful to you.
- This is a barebones blog setup and I will eventually start missing all of the features that Wordpress has. In turn, it will hopefully cause me to start messing around with Gatsby, React & the JS ecosystem. F-U-N.

For those who care to know, this blog was setup using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">gatsby-starter-blog</a> & <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">netlify</a>. Was able to do it in under an hour and FOR FREE! What sorcery is this i dont even. Mad props. If not for them, I'd still be attemping to get PHP7 talk nice to nginx & mysql while figuring out the right SEO plugin. Done is decidedly better than perfect.

Also, I'll be going from being @MindYoghurt on Twitter for 10+ years to my full name. I no longer am the Engineering undergrad when I decided that my angst would make for good humour. Also, back in the early days of Twitter, I had @satish for a couple of weeks. Do I regret giving that up for being the English version of "Dimaag ka Dahi"? Nope. Not one bit.

See you around!
